            <h2> <a name="what">What do volunteers do?</a></h2>
            
            Volunteers at our festivals and events help with various tasks, such as assisting guests with directions & information, working at sales stations such as water, merchandise & beverage garden, helping out with our children’s activities, encouraging attendees to Think, Be, Live GREEN – as part of our Green Team and many more fun areas.  For a full list of available volunteer opportunities and descriptions, please refer to the list of festivals here and select the opportunities that interest you.
            <br />
            <h2> <a name="what2">What should volunteers bring and wear?</a></h2>
            The festivals take place outside rain or shine, so dress accordingly and wear comfortable shoes. All volunteers must wear our official Volunteer T-shirt during their shifts.  Those volunteering with a group or organization can wear their own nametags or we can design some for you! Please leave all valuables at home. You are encouraged to bring a small bag to keep with you for personal belongings such as: layers of clothing, sunscreen, ID, etc.

            You will have the opportunity to purchase Summer of the Arts merchandise as well as food and drink from vendors on-site.
