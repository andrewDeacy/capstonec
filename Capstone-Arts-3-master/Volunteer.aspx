        <p>What could be more fun than volunteering at any one of the Summer of the Arts events this summer? These great festivals and events are so successful because of the talent and energy provided by the hundreds of volunteers who volunteer with us anywhere from 2 hours to 200 hours! We strongly encourage YOUR participation. Find out all about what it’s like to be a volunteer for Summer of the Arts on our Volunteer FAQ page!</p>
